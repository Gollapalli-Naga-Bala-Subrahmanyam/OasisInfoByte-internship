            <h3>Chat Application using Network Programming </h3>
            <pre>         Network programming is a tool used for making connection easy to all the people and
          makes it mote helpful to all the people. The client and server is used to connect with the
          help of TCP server â€“client code and they form a network between the server and client-client
          to make the better of the program. the code is usually used to reduce the data to connect 
          the two codes using sockets and the data was transferred from server to client and client 
          to server, Solution to this challenge is TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) which will 
          first setups the connection and then allows to send the message.

          <h3>Smart Home using Sensor Components</h3>
          <pre>      In this project a design and implementation concept for a smart home automation system 
            based on Arduino microcontroller board was successfully developed. Sensors are connected 
            to the microcontroller board that is the Uno board. The smart home consists of all the home 
            appliances can be monitored, controlled and accessed automatically in response to any 
            signals came from related sensors with the help of arduino and we can observe the output or 
            the observations on the serial monitor in the compiler through laptop.</pre>
